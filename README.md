Network Analysis and Data Visualization Computed in R

This folder shows sample work of me using network analysis as a tool that offers insights into the construction of social, biological, and information systems. Assisted with the compuational tool of R, it scaffolds the terminology and theoretical underpinnings of network science. It also introduces the data wrangling, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, critical analysis, and data visualization tools that often accompany the studies of networks.
